This repository contains a collection of codes I have written.
Some of the codes require additional files to run. If a code requires additional files it is mentioned in the first few lines
and the additional file can be found under the "additionalfiles" folder

These codes have been developed for personal use, not public use, so there are minimal comments and poor architecture
